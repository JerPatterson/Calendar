Project description
	This program is made in other to make oerations with the Gregorian calendar's concepts. For now, the main features
	targeted by the program is to be able to get the number of days between two dates and to get the date by adding a
	number of days to another one. 

	Eventually, a data structure will allow the user to add events and associate them to specific dates.


*Disclaimer
	The main goal of this project to make use of all the notions of C++ and software architecture learned. As of now 
	there are mistakes made in the design and development. Of course with time the programming good practises will be
	applied more rigorously as the knowledge of them gets better.
